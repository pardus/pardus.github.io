# Introduction to GTK Development with Python

GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a popular toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications. It provides a set of libraries and tools to build interactive and visually appealing applications. In this introduction, we will focus on using GTK with Python, which provides a simple and elegant way to develop cross-platform GUI applications.

## Learning Resources

Below are some useful resources for learning GTK development with Python:

1. [GTK4 Official Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)

   > For the most comprehensive and up-to-date information, the official GTK4 documentation is the go-to resource. It covers all aspects of GTK4 development in detail, including widgets, layout management, event handling, and more.

2. [GTK4 Python (lazka) Documentation](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/)

   > This resource provides comprehensive documentation for the PyGObject library, which is the Python binding for GTK4. It includes detailed information on classes, methods, and properties available in GTK4, making it an essential reference for GTK development in Python.

3. [GTK4 Python (amoleenar) Documentation](https://amolenaar.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/pygobject-docs/)

   > This documentation complements the official documentation by offering more insights into GTK4 development with Python. It can be particularly helpful in understanding specific examples and use cases.

4. [GTK3 Python (readthedocs) Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

   > Although this tutorial focuses on GTK3, it can still be valuable for beginners to understand the basic concepts of GTK development with Python. Many of the fundamental principles and functionalities remain consistent between GTK3 and GTK4, making this a good starting point for learning the basics.

5. [Style Classes (libadwaita)](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/style-classes.html)
   > While developing GTK applications, understanding style classes and their usage is crucial for creating consistent and visually appealing UIs. This resource provides insight into libadwaita's style classes, a set of CSS-like style rules that can be applied to GTK widgets.

## Note: Updating Resources

We are committed to keeping this guide up-to-date with the latest resources. As new documentation or tutorials for GTK development with Python become available, we will review and add them to the list above. Be sure to check back regularly for new and improved learning materials!
